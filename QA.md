# Implementation and QA summary

## Passed
- `npm run build` — completed successfully.
- `npm run check` — passed static production artifact tests.
- Official uploaded 1254×1254 logo copied unchanged (same SHA-256 in public asset and production output).
- All five supplied exact palette tokens present in CSS.
- Six existing roster slots strictly enforced by build script; incomplete names and roles remain unpublished instead of appearing as placeholder profiles.
- Verified production-served HTML returned HTTP 200 via local Node server.
- Automated headless Chromium checks at 1440×900, 768×1024, and 390×844: zero page-JavaScript errors; no horizontal overflow; official logo loaded at natural resolution.
- Mobile navigation toggle and closing behaviour checked.
- Source is fully self-contained with no package dependencies or third-party CDN requirements.
- Concept model and non-competition-vehicle label visible in scene interface.

## Environment testing limitation
The available sandbox Chromium is administratively prevented from creating WebGL contexts (even with SwiftShader flags). Its fallback was exercised and works; **GPU rendering could not be verified in this environment**. Test the 3D scene in an unrestricted Chrome, Safari, or Firefox browser with WebGL enabled.

## Input limitations / integration required
The original Race Pakistan source repository was not provided; this deliverable is a new staging site and cannot directly patch or deploy the existing website.
The six team member names and roles, actual vehicle model, and official team/event records were not supplied. These have not been invented, overwritten, or falsely asserted.
Import the original six names and roles *verbatim* into `data/team.json`, and add verified competition/team milestones before release.
